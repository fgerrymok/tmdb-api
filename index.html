            <h1 id="home">Web APIs - What are they??</h1>

            <section class="section-1" id="section-1">
                <h2>What is it/are they?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's take a look at APIs in general. The acronym
                    <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
                    stands for: <em>Application Programming Interface</em>, but
                    what does that really mean?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In simplest terms, an interface is something that allows two things to interact with each other. Furthermore, they
                    usually "abstract" more complicated processes making them
                    "easy-to-use". A good example is a light switch, there are
                    very technical electronics underneath, but the easy to use
                    interface of a lightswitch makes the lights turn on, or off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the “application programming” side, it's a
                    fancy way of saying an interface that allows two applications to interact. In the case of our code along how our website can interact with the TMDP API.
                </p>
                <p>It's been described by a certain professor as:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "code that's already been written by other developers,
                        designed to make our jobs easier"
                    </p>
                    <cite>Randy Bobandy</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    One API web developers use constantly (to repeat another
                    thing that professor has said) is the
                    <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> or
                    <em>document object model</em>. So, whenever anyone uses
                    <code>document.getElementByID()</code>,
                    <code>querySelector()</code>, or
                    <code>querySelectorAll()</code> in JavaScript, they're using
                    an API.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img
                        src="./images/api-event.png"
                        alt="A basic diagram that visually explains how APIs work and how they abstract functions for easier use."
                    />
                    <figcaption>Source: Randy Bobandy</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Another API constantly in use by developers is called
                    <em>Event</em>. Yup, you guessed it, every time
                    <code>.addEventListener</code> is used it's using the Event
                    API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the <abbr title="document object model">DOM</abbr> and
                    event are great representations of
                    <q>code that's already been written that makes our lives
                        easier</q>. I don't know about you guys but at this point in my learning if I had to figure out all of the code needed to achieve the same thing I would be in trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding Web APIs specifically, the technical definition is “an API that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol”. Super helpful, right? It simply means an API that can be used and accessed over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, a simple definition for a web API is a block of
                    code that has been written by somebody else that makes our
                    lives easier which can be accessed over the internet. Some
                    are free to use while others require payment, almost all
                    require users to sign up for an API key.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="section-2" id="section-2">
                <h2>How do they work??</h2>
                <p>
                    Web APIs are like a bridge between your code and the
                    resources on a server that you're trying to access, whether
                    it be a data source, an application, or anything in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most web APIs (free or paid) require their users to register for an account and API key to be able to use their
                    services/resources. These API keys are used to authenticate
                    the user making the request for both security purposes as
                    well as monitoring and/or limiting usage. They will also always do two things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Set the rules you need to follow for interacting with it (including authenticating the user via API key).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manage the data transfer that happens between the code
                        (like your website) making the request and the server
                        that sends a response.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <figure>
                    <img
                        src="./images/api-working.png"
                        alt="A very basic diagram of how APIs work/communicate between the the browser, internet, and hosted server."
                    />
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Rules? What rules? Those rules will (hopefully) be explained in the specific APIs documentation. Two things that should always be included in these rules are: the APIs <em>endpoints</em> needed to connect to it, and the <em>protocol</em> the API is using.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Endpoint:</b> The URL address(es) of the API web server
                    that you're requesting data from.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>API Protocol:</b> specifies how it connects to the
                    internet, how other parties connect to it, and how it
                    receives and transmits data. There are several API protocols in use today:
                    <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Simple Object Access">SOAP</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr>, and GraphQL, to name a few. That being said, the REST or
                    <em>Representational State Transfer</em> protocol (which
                    technically isn't a protocol at all but a set of guidelines
                    on how to use certain HTTP methods) is the most widely used
                    for Web APIs today. A recent survey shows that nearly 80% of public web APIs use the REST protocol and because of this it's the one we're going to focus on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> protocol works by using <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>'s built in methods: <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and/or <code>DELETE</code> which (with a
                    valid API key) connect to the API's server using specific URLs/endpoints.
                </p>

                <h3>What are these HTTP Methods?</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP or <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> is the
                    foundation of how everything communicates over the internet.
                    There are nine HTTP methods that can be used, however the
                    four main ones that are utilized to communicate with web
                    APIs are <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
                    <code>PUT</code>, and/or <code>DELETE</code>.
                </p>
                <img
                    src="./images/get-protocol.png"
                    alt="Simple diagram of different HTTP methods connecting a browser and server"
                />
                <p>
                    <code>GET</code> is the HTTP method used to make requests to
                    a server and the response is typically returned as
                    <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> data
                    (although other data types like
                    <abbr title="Extensible Markup Languag">XML</abbr> can be
                    returned as well). <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>,
                    and/or <code>DELETE</code> on the otherhand are used to
                    submit, create, or delete resources on that server and are
                    generally used by those actually developing the API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since (most) public web APIs only allow
                    <code>GET</code> requests and because <code>GET</code> is
                    also the HTTP method being called when we use <code>fetch()</code> in JavaScript (which is also an API) it's what we'll be focusing on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you send a request to an API it's made up of 4 parts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Method:</b> The HTTP method used to make the request,
                        <code>GET</code> in our case.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>URL/Endpoint:</b> The address of the API web server
                        that you're requesting data from.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Parameters:</b> Defines what we're looking for in our
                        API request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Headers:</b> Generally contains an API Key to
                        authenticate the request as well as specifies the format
                        of the data being requested.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The response is also made up of four parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Response Status code:</b> The HTTP status code that
                        is returned by the API which let's us know if the
                        request was successful or not. This code can be found in
                        the devtools (if you remember our API class with Randy),
                        the most common are 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500
                        (Internal Server Error).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data:</b> The data that is returned by the API,
                        usually in
                        <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>
                        format but other formats like
                        <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> can
                        also be requested.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Headers:</b> Used to specify the format of the data
                        being returned (JSON, XML, etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Links:</b> Provides more detail about the data, often
                        including links to source, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Parameters:</b> There are several types of parameters
                    used in REST APIs, the most common and the one we'll be
                    using is known as a <em>query string</em>. You've likely
                    seen them in the browser's address bar, most likely after
                    searching for something from a search engine like Google.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an API you can see the query string at the end of a URL
                    or Endpoint, after the <code>?</code> character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example:
                    <code
                        >https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?language=en-US&page=1</code
                    >, the query string parameters are the
                    <code>language=us</code> and the <code>page=1</code> in the above URL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Headers:</b> In the headers is where you will specify the
                    format of the data you are requesting from the API, more
                    often than not a JSON file, as well as authenticating your
                    request by including your API key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, your code may look something like this: <br />
                    <code
                        >headers: {<br />
                        accept: "application/json",<br />
                        Authorization: "APIKEY", <br />
                        }</code
                    >
                    <br />
                    As you can see they're accepting json file format and are
                    including their API key for authorization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the API receives a valid request it will run a function
                    (or more likely multiple functions depending on how complex
                    the API is) and return whatever was requested.
                </p>

                />
                <p>
                    This could be as simple as a single string, an image, or
                    something more complex. If we take the TMDB API as an
                    example, we'll be requesting different resources from a
                    database of movie data (like images, ratings info, release
                    dates, etc.). Since the data in the APIs response is in a JSON file, we will need to parse it using <code>.then</code> as part of our <code>fetch()</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, the API will only return the data that was
                    requested. It is up to the developer to properly
                    handle/parse the response.

                <h2>Why and Where Would you use them?</h2>
                <p>
                    From a development perspective there are several reasons
                    where and why you would use APIs. Arguably the two biggest
                    are:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Functionality</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You can use them to provide access to certain features
                        and functions that would be difficult to build yourself.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Speed</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You can add those features and significantly reduce
                        development time.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Utilizing APIs is a good way to take advantage of existing
                    resources compared to having to build them from scratch.
                    Because of this you can offer a variety of features. It
                    could be connectivity to local weather forecasts, traffic,
                    social media, nearly anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A real world example (which may sound familiar) that
                    highlights both of these reasons is if someone wanted a
                    website that included a selection of changing cat images.
                    One option is implementing this ourselves.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img
                        src="./images/api-cat.png"
                        alt="A basic diagram showing how an API works when called from a browser to show different cat images."
                    />
                    <figcaption>Source: Randy Bobandy</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    That would entail spending time scouring the web trying to
                    find as many copyright free images of cats as possible,
                    building the database, filling it with those images, paying
                    to host it on a server, and every other step in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Or</em>, we could choose the second option: we use the
                    web API that's already built to do just that.
                </p>
                <h3>Other real-word examples of using web APIs:</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>An e-Commerce Site</dt>
                    <dd>
                        It needs a secure way for customers to pay as well as
                        being able to ship/track their orders. You could code
                        those from scratch or use existing APIs like the ones
                        available from Paypal and Fed Ex.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>A Fantasy Football League</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Participants want to be able to change their roster,
                        look at player stats, and get updates on any sport
                        specific news stories, all of which need to update in
                        real-time. There are APIs for that.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Movie Database</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You need to create a movie database using an API for a
                        school project... hint hint.

                </dl>
                <p>
                    It's easy to see that there are a plethora of reasons
                    where and why individuals would want to use web APIs. If we
                    come back to the quote we used to describe APIs: 
                    <q>code that's already been written by other developers, designed to make our jobs easier</q> the amount of use cases becomes nearly infinite.

                        businesses. Using an API to “outsource” it can be more
                        cost-effective.

                    <dd>
                        Web APIs often have extensive feature sets built in
                        which in-house developers may not have the time or
                        skillset to build.

                    <dd>
                        The developers writing the API are usually experts in
                        their respective fields. Utilizing the API takes
                        advantage of that expertise.

                    <dd>
                        Most large web APIs are built to handle significant
                        volumes of requests and can do so without issue. Smaller
                        companies may not be able to handle the amount of

                    <dd>
                        Arguably the biggest disadvantage. Access is totally
                        dependent on the availability and reliability of the API
                        host. If it goes down or experiences other problems,
                        then it's no longer useable. Older APIs can also be
                        quite "heavy" as they rarely delete older versions after
                        updating to insure backwards compatibility.

                    <dt>Lack of Documentation</dt>

                        Lack of, or - even worse - confusing documentation of
                        how to setup and utitlize the API makes it difficult to implement
                        (our group had a difficult time trying to use/figure out
                        the Instagram API, or anything from Meta realistically).

                        Some parts of the world may not be able to access, or in
                        certain cases will actually block access to the hosting
                        provider of the API. China is unable to use Google APIs

                        Web APIs have specific, pre-built functionality which
                        may not suit every use case forcing developers to work
                        within the confines of the API.
