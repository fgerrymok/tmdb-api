                <h2>What are they?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's take a look at APIs in general. The acronym
                    <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
                    stands for: <em>Application Programming Interface</em>, but
                    what does that really mean?
                </p>
                <p>It's been described by a certain professor as:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "code that's already been written by other developers,
                        designed to make our jobs easier"
                    </p>
                    <cite>Randy Bobandy</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    APIs can be located locally, or online. One local API web
                    developers use constantly (to repeat another thing that
                    professor has said) is the
                    <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> or
                    <em>document object model</em>. So, whenever somebody uses
                    <code>document.getElementByID()</code>,
                    <code>querySelector()</code>, or
                    <code>querySelectorAll()</code> in JavaScript, they're using
                    an API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another API constantly in use by developers is called
                    <em>Event</em>. Yup, you guessed it, every time
                    <code>.addEventListener</code> is used it's using the Event
                    API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and
                    event are great representations of
                    <q
                        >code that's already been written that makes our lives
                        easier</q
                    >. I don't know about you guys but at this point in my
                    learning if I had to figure out all of the code needed to
                    achieve the same thing I would be in trouble.

                <p>
                    Regarding Web APIs specifically, the technical definition is
                    “an API that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol”. Super
                    helpful, right? It simply means an API that can be used and
                    accessed over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, a web API is a block of code that has been
                    written by somebody else that makes our lives easier which
                    can be accessed over the internet. Some are free to use
                    while others require payment, almost all require users to
                    sign up for an API key.

                <h2>How do they work??</h2>
                <p>
                    Web APIs are like a bridge between your code and the
                    resources on a server that you're trying to access, whether
                    it be a data source, an application, or anything in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most web APIs (free or paid) require their users to register
                    for an account and API key to be able to use their
                    services/resources.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Sets rules you need to follow for interacting with it
                        (including authenticating the user via API key).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manage the data transfer that happens between the code
                        (like your website) making the request and the server
                        that sends a response (often in JSON and less often in
                        XML format).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    Rules? What rules? How do we know what those rules are?
                    Those rules will (hopefully) be explained in the specific
                    APIs documentation. Another thing that will be explained is
                    the specific <em>protocol</em> the API is using.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The protocol an API uses specifies how it connects to the
                    internet, how other parties connect to it, and how it
                    receives and transmits information. There are several API
                    protocols in use today:
                    <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Simple Object Access">SOAP</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr>, and GraphQL,
                    to name a few. That being said, the REST or
                    <em>Representational State Transfer</em> protocol (which
                    technically isn't a protocol at all but a set of guidelines)
                    is the most widely used for Web APIs today. Because of this
                    it's the one we're going to focus on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The
                    <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>
                    protocol works by using
                    <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>'s
                    built in methods: <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
                    <code>PUT</code>, and/or <code>DELETE</code> which (with a
                    valid API key) connect to the API's server using specific
                    URLs known as <em>Endpoints</em>.
                </p>
                <h3>What are these HTTP Methods?</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP or <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> is the
                    foundation of how everything communicates over the internet.
                    There are nine HTTP methods that can be used, however the
                    four main ones that are utilized to communicate with web
                    APIs are <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
                    <code>PUT</code>, and/or <code>DELETE</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>GET</code> is the HTTP method used to make requests to
                    a server (whereas <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>,
                    and/or <code>DELETE</code> are used to submit, create, or
                    delete resources on that server).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since (most) public web APIs only allow
                    <code>GET</code> requests and because <code>GET</code> is
                    also the HTTP method being called when we use
                    <code>fetch()</code> in JavaScript it's what we'll be
                    focusing on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Endpoints</em> are simply URLs that can be used to send
                    requests to an API.
                </p>

                <h2>What do they do?</h2>

                <p>
                    When you send a request to an API it's (generally) made up
                    of 4 parts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Method:</b> The HTTP method used to make the request,
                        <code>GET</code> in our case.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>URL/Endpoint:</b> The address of the API web server
                        that you're requesting data from.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Parameters:</b> The data that defines what we're
                        looking for in our API request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Headers:</b> Generally contains an API Key to
                        authenticate the request as well as specifies the format
                        of the data being requested.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The response is also made up of four parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Response Status code:</b> The HTTP status code that
                        is returned by the API which let's us know if the
                        request was successful or not. This code can be found in
                        the devtools (if you remember our API class with Randy),
                        the most common are 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500
                        (Internal Server Error).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Data:</b> The data that is returned by the API
                        (usually in
                        <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr>
                        sometimes in
                        <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>
                        format).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Headers:</b> Used to specify the format of the data
                        being returned (which hopefully matches the type
                        specified in the request).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Links:</b> Provides more detail about the data, often
                        including links to source, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There are several types of parameters used in REST APIs, the
                    most common and the one we'll be using is known as a
                    <em>query string</em>. You've likely seen them in the
                    browser's address bar, most likely after looking for
                    something from a search engine like Google.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see them in the query string at the end of a URL or
                    Endpoint, after the <code>?</code> character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example:
                    <code
                        >https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?language=en-US&page=1</code
                    >, the query string parameters are the
                    <code>language=us</code> and the <code></code>page=1
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the headers is where you will specify the format of the
                    data you are requesting from the API, more often than not a
                    JSON file, as well as authenticating your request by
                    including your API key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, your code may look something like this: <br />
                    <code
                        >headers: {<br />
                        accept: "json",<br />
                        Authorization: "APIKEY", <br />
                        }</code
                    >
                    <br />
                    As you can see they're accepting json file format and
                    authorizing with their API key.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the API receives a valid request it will run a function
                    (or more likely multiple functions depending on how complex
                    the API is) and return whatever was requested.

                    This could be as simple as a single image, something more
                    complex like a video, or an entire database of info and
                    different media all within a json file. If we take the TMDB
                    API as an example, we'll be requesting different resources
                    from a database of movie data (like images, ratings info,
                    release dates, etc.). Since the data in the APIs response is
                    in a
                    <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file,
                    we will need to parse it using <code>.then</code> as part of
                    our <code>fetch()</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, the API will only return the data that was
                    requested. It is up to the developer to properly
                    handle/parse the response and display the results.

                <h2>Why and Where Would you use them?</h2>
                <p>
                    From a development perspective there are several reasons
                    where and why you would use APIs. Arguably the two biggest
                    are:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Functionality</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You can use them to provide access to certain features
                        and functions that would be difficult to build yourself.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Speed</dt>
                    <dd>You can use them to reduce development time.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Utilizing existing APIs is a good way to use existing
                    resources compared to having to build them from
                    scratch.Because of this you can offer a variety of
                    connectivity to local weather forecasts, traffic updates,
                    social media, nearly anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A real world example (which may sound familiar) that
                    highlights both of these reasons is if someone wanted a
                    website that included a selection of changing cat images.
                    One option is implementing this ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That would entail spending time scouring the web trying to
                    find as many copyright free images of cats as possible,
                    building the database, filling it with those images, paying
                    to host it on a server, and every other step in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Or</em>, we could choose the second option: we use the
                    web API that's already built to do just that.
                </p>
                <h3>Other real-word examples of using APIs:</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>An e-Commerce Site</dt>
                    <dd>
                        It needs a secure way for customers to pay as well as
                        being able to ship/track their orders. You could code
                        those from scratch or use existing APIs like the ones
                        available from Paypal and Fed Ex.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>A Fantasy Football League</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Participants want to be change their roster, to look at
                        players stats, and any sport specific news stories, all
                        of which updates in real-time. There are APIs for that.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Movie Database</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You need to create a movie database using an API for a
                        school project... hint hint.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    As it's plain to see, there are a variety of reasons where
                    and why individuals would want to use one or more web APIs.
                    If we come back to the quote from section 1:
                    <q
                        >code that's already been written by other developers,
                        designed to make our jobs easier</q
                    >
                    the amount of use cases becomes nearly infinite.

                            Using web APIs allows developers to utilize code

                            smaller businesses. Using an API to “outsource” it
                            can be more cost-effective.

                            whereas in-house developers may not have the time or
                            skillset to build.

                            Most large web APIs are built to handle significant
                            volumes of requests and can do so without issue.
                            Smaller companies may not be able to handle the
                            increased traffic.

                            Arguably the biggest disadvantage. Access is totally
                            dependent on the availability and reliability of the
                            API host. If it goes down or experiences other
                            problems, then it's no longer useable. Also, if they
                            make changes, it can disrupt your code forcing you
                            to spend extra time fixing it

                            of how to use or the API makes it difficult to
                            implement (think of Frazer looking at Instagram or
