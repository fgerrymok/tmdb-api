                <h2>What is it/are they?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let’s take a look at APIs in general. The acronym
                    <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
                    stands for: <em>Application Programming Interface</em>, but
                    what does that really mean?
                </p>
                <p>It's been described by a certain professor as:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "code that's already been written by other developers,
                        designed to make our jobs easier"
                    </p>
                    <cite>Randy Bobandy</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    One API web developers use constantly (to repeat another
                    thing that professor has said) is the
                    <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> or
                    <em>document object model</em>. So, whenever anyone uses
                    <code>document.getElementByID()</code>,
                    <code>querySelector()</code>, or
                    <code>querySelectorAll()</code> in JavaScript, they're using
                    an API.
                </p>
                <img
                    src="./images/api-event.png"
                    alt="An exaclidraw image visually explaining how APIs work and how they abstract functions for easier use."
                />
                <p>
                    Another API constantly in use by developers is called
                    <em>Event</em>. Yup, you guessed it, every time
                    <code>.addEventListener</code> is used it's using the Event
                    API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the <abbr title="document object model">DOM</abbr> and
                    event are great representations of
                    <q
                        >code that's already been written that makes our lives
                        easier</q
                    >. I don't know about you guys but at this point in my
                    learning if I had to figure out all of the code needed to
                    achieve the same thing I would be in trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding Web APIs specifically, the technical definition is
                    “an API that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol”. Super
                    helpful, right? It simply means an API that can be used and
                    accessed over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, a web API is a block of code that has been
                    written by somebody else that makes our lives easier which
                    can be accessed over the internet. Some are free to use
                    while others require payment, almost all require users to
                    sign up for an API key.

                <p>
                    Web APIs are like a bridge between your code and the
                    resources on a server that you’re trying to access, whether
                    it be a data source, an application, or anything in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most web APIs (free or paid) require their users to register
                    for an account and API key to be able to use their
                    services/resources.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Sets rules you need to follow for interacting with it
                        (including authenticating the user via API key).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manage the data transfer that happens between the code
                        (like your website) making the request and the server
                        that sends a response (often in JSON and less often in
                        XML format).
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <img
                    src="./images/api-working.png"
                    alt="A very basic diagram of how APIs work/communicate between the the browser, internet, and hosted server."
                />
                <p>
                    Rules? What rules? How do we know what those rules are?
                    Those rules will (hopefully) be explained in the specific
                    APIs documentation. Another thing that will be explained is
                    the specific <em>protocol</em> the API is using.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The protocol an API uses specifies how it connects to the
                    internet, how other parties connect to it, and how it
                    receives and transmits information. There are several API
                    protocols in use today: <abbr title=""></abbr>REST, SOAP,
                    RPC, GraphQL, to name a few. That being said, the REST or
                    RESTful (Representational State Transfer) protocol (which
                    technically isn't an actual protocol but a set of
                    guidelines) is the most widely used for Web APIs today.
                    Because of this it's the one we're going to focus on.
