                <h2>What is it/are they?</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's take a look at APIs in general. The acronym
                    <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
                    stands for: <em>Application Programming Interface</em>, but
                    what does that really mean?
                </p>
                <p>It's been described by a certain professor as:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "code that's already been written by other developers,
                        designed to make our jobs easier"
                    </p>
                    <cite>Randy Bobandy</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    One API web developers use constantly (to repeat another
                    thing that professor has said) is the
                    <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> or
                    <em>document object model</em>. So, whenever anyone uses
                    <code>document.getElementByID()</code>,
                    <code>querySelector()</code>, or
                    <code>querySelectorAll()</code> in JavaScript, they're using
                    an API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another API constantly in use by developers is called
                    <em>Event</em>. Yup, you guessed it, every time
                    <code>.addEventListener</code> is used it's using the Event
                    API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the <abbr title="document object model">DOM</abbr> and
                    event are great representations of
                    <q
                        >code that's already been written that makes our lives
                        easier</q
                    >. I don't know about you guys but at this point in my
                    learning if I had to figure out all of the code needed to
                    achieve the same thing I would be in trouble.

                <p>
                    Regarding Web APIs specifically, the technical definition is
                    “an API that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol”. Super
                    helpful, right? It simply means an API that can be used and
                    accessed over the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, a web API is a block of code that has been
                    written by somebody else that makes our lives easier which
                    can be accessed over the internet. Some are free to use
                    while others require payment, almost all require users to
                    sign up for an API key.

                <p>
                    Web APIs are like a bridge between your code and the
                    resources on a server that you’re trying to access, whether
                    it be a data source, an application, or anything in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most web APIs (free or paid) require their users to register
                    for an account and API key to be able to use their
                    services/resources.
                </p>

                        Sets rules you need to follow for interacting with it
                        (including authenticating the user via API key).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manage the data transfer that happens between the code
                        (like your website) making the request and the server
                        that sends a response (often in JSON and less often in
                        XML format).
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Rules? What rules? How do we know what those rules are?
                    Those rules will (hopefully) be explained in the specific
                    APIs documentation. Another thing that will be explained is
                    the specific <em>protocol</em> the API is using.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The protocol an API uses specifies how it connects to the
                    internet, how other parties connect to it, and how it
                    receives and transmits information. There are several API
                    protocols in use today:
                    <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Simple Object Access">SOAP</abbr>,
                    <abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr>, and GraphQL,
                    to name a few. That being said, the REST or
                    <em>Representational State Transfer</em> protocol (which
                    technically isn't a protocol at all but a set of guidelines)
                    is the most widely used for Web APIs today. Because of this
                    it's the one we're going to focus on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The
                    <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>
                    protocol works by using
                    <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>'s
                    built in methods: <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
                    <code>PUT</code>, and/or <code>DELETE</code> which (with a
                    valid API key) connect to the API's server using specific
                    URLs known as <em>Endpoints</em>.
                </p>
                <h3>What are these HTTP Methods?</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTP or <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> is the
                    foundation of how everything communicates over the internet.
                    There are nine HTTP methods that can be used, however the
                    four main ones that are utilized to communicate with web
                    APIs are <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>,
                    <code>PUT</code>, and/or <code>DELETE</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>GET</code> is the HTTP method used to make requests to
                    a server (whereas <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>,
                    and/or <code>DELETE</code> are used to submit, create, or
                    delete resources on that server).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since (most) public web APIs only allow
                    <code>GET</code> requests and because <code>GET</code> is
                    also the HTTP method being called when we use
                    <code>fetch()</code> in JavaScript it's what we'll be
                    focusing on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Endpoints</em> are simply URLs that can be used to send
                    requests to an API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the API receives a valid request it will run a function
                    (or more likely multiple functions depending on how complex
                    the API is) and return whatever was requested, usually in a
                    <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file.
                </p>
                <figure>

                <p>
                    This could be as simple as a single image or something more
                    complex like a video. If we take the TMDB API as an example,
                    we'll be requesting different resources from a database of
                    movie data (like images, ratings info, release dates, etc.).
                    Since the data in the APIs response is in a
                    <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file,
                    we will need to parse it using <code>.then</code> as part of
                    our <code>fetch()</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember, the API will only return the data that was
                    requested. It is up to the developer to properly
                    handle/parse the response and display the results.

            <section class="section-4" id="section-4">
                <h2>Why and Where Would you use them?</h2>
                <p>
                    From a development perspective there are several reasons
                    where and why you would use APIs. Arguably the two biggest
                    are:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Functionality</dt>
                    <dd>
                        You can use them to provide access to certain features
                        and functions that would be difficult to build yourself.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Speed</dt>
                    <dd>You can use them to reduce development time.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Utilizing existing APIs is a good way to use existing
                    resources compared to having to build them from
                    scratch.Because of this you can offer a variety of
                    connectivity to local weather forecasts, traffic updates,
                    social media, nearly anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A real world example (which may sound familiar) that
                    highlights both of these reasons is if someone wanted a
                    website that included a selection of changing cat images.
                    One option is implementing this ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That would entail spending time scouring the web trying to
                    find as many copyright free images of cats as possible,
                    building the database, filling it with those images, paying
                    to host it on a server, and every other step in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Or</em>, we could choose the second option: we use the
                    web API that's already built to do just that.
                </p>
                <h3>Other real-word examples of using APIs:</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>An e-Commerce Site</dt>
                    <dd>
                        It needs a secure way for customers to pay as well as
                        being able to ship/track their orders. You could code
                        those from scratch or use existing APIs like the ones
                        available from Paypal and Fed Ex.

                        Participants want to be change their roster, to look at
                        players stats, and any sport specific news stories, all
                        of which updates in real-time. There are APIs for that.

                        You need to create a movie database using an API for a

                    As it's plain to see, there are a variety of reasons where
                    and why individuals would want to use one or more web APIs.
                    If we come back to the quote from section 1:
                    <q
                        >code that's already been written by other developers,
                        designed to make our jobs easier</q
                    >
                    the amount of use cases becomes nearly infinite.
